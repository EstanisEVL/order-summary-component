## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- GIT

### What I learned

In this project I learned to implement different hover states in different elements. I also used the challenge to improve the way I replicate element sizes and colors in order to get the final project to look as close to the design as possible.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me create the shadows for this project. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
